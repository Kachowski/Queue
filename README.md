The first file, QueueNode, is a data storage type that holds a piece of data and the node that is to the right and to the left of it. The second file, Queue, creates an list of QueueNodes using different methods to add and remove the QueueNodes from right to left. The last file, QueueTester, tests all of the methods in both of the other files.
